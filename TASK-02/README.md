# Image Classification Project using Fashion MNIST Dataset

This project focuses on training and evaluating different machine learning models to classify images of clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

---

## Dataset Overview
The Fashion MNIST  train.csv dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of clothing items across 10 categories, such as shirts, dresses, and sneakers. It is widely used for machine learning and deep learning tasks.

👉 **Download the dataset**: [Fashion MNIST train.csv Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist)
