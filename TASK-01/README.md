# Project Instructions: Linear Regression Task

## Overview
This project provides a custom implementation of a **Linear Regression** model and includes a Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate its use. The objective is to train a regression model to predict outcomes based on input data.

### Files in the Repository
1. **`lr_module.py`**:
   - Contains the implementation of the `LinearRegression` class.
   - Includes methods for training (`fit`) and predicting (`predict`) a linear regression model.

2. **`TASK-01.ipynb`**:
   - A Jupyter Notebook designed to demonstrate the usage of the `LinearRegression` class for training and prediction.
   - Provides example workflows, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## How to Set Up the Project
Follow these steps to set up and execute the tasks:

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`

Install the required dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone <repository-link>
```

Replace `<repository-link>` with the actual Git repository URL.

## Instructions to Run the Code

### Step 1: Understand the `LinearRegression` Class
- Open the `lr_module.py` file to review the implementation of the Linear Regression model.
- Key features:
  - **`__init__(learning_rate, iterations)`**: Initialize the model with a specified learning rate and number of iterations.
  - **`fit(X, y)`**: Train the model using input features (`X`) and target values (`y`).
  - **`predict(X)`**: Predict outcomes for a given input dataset (`X`).

### Step 2: Open and Run the Jupyter Notebook

1. Open `TASK-01.ipynb` and follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess your data.
   - Train the Linear Regression model using the `fit` method.
   - Predict outcomes using the `predict` method.
   - Evaluate model performance.

## Troubleshooting
1. **ModuleNotFoundError**:
   - Ensure `lr_module.py` is in the same directory as your notebook or script.
   - Alternatively, adjust the Python path to include the file location.

2. **Convergence Issues**:
   - Adjust the learning rate or number of iterations in the `LinearRegression` class initialization.
