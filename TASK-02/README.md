# Image Classification Project using MNIST Dataset

This project focuses on training and evaluating different machine learning models to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

---

## Dataset Overview
The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9). It is widely used for machine learning and deep learning tasks.

ðŸ‘‰ **Download the dataset**: [MNIST Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)

## Project Highlights
- **Data Preprocessing**: Load, explore, and prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Model Training**: Train multiple classifiers, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
- **Model Evaluation**: Analyze performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - Confusion Matrices
